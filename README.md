This repository is used as an exercise to apply what I have learned on basic HTML.
HTML knowledges applied in this exercise are as follow:
    1. HTML Boilerplate (!DOCTYPE html, <html> with lang="en", <head> with <meta charset="utf-8">, <body>)
    2. HTML <p>, <ol>, and <ul> tags, with <li> as the details of ordered/unordered list
    3. HTML <img> tag to display image on my webpage and <a> tag to embed a link to my webpage
